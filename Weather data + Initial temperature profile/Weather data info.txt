Weather data for analysis were obtained from a station located in Sodankylä Tähtelä (Finland) (https://en.ilmatieteenlaitos.fi/download-observations, accessed on 08.07.2021).

Four files are required; they consist of a list of yearly averaged measurements over ten years and then interpolated to obtain a value every 20 seconds.
