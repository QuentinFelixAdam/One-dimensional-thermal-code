# One-dimensional-thermal-code
This Fortran code allows the calculations of temperature levels within a three-layered medium. It accounts for the effects of latent heat , as well as a heat source placed at some depth within the first layer. The implemented model is utilized for thermal calculations within an asphalt pavement system to track the frost front penetration. The thermal properties found in the parameters file represent an idealized pavement system, and the heat source represents the operation of an array of heating elements in the form of ribbons. This code was developped as part of the Snowless project.

There is a possibility to parallelize the code with OpenMP.
